Guidelines for the project:

* Decide the topic (by now it should be done)
* Check if know the task clearly, 
  * Is it supervised? or unsupervised task?
  * Pattern detection or anomoly detection?
  * Write down the task description, input, expected output, potential challenges you expect
* if you have the appropriate data for the task
  * Look for multiple datasets preferably
  * if it is supervised task do you have labels?
  * If you want to use deep learning do you have enough data?
* Decide your roles in the project
  * Divide tasks team work is important
  * Roughly each member should contribute for 1/3rd of the load (or whatever your team size is)
* Cleanup, Explore the data
  * Remove noise if any
  * Check for outliers
  * visualize
  * apply SVD or PCA or TSNE to visuzalize
* Decide which data mining algorithm is suitable?
  * Possibly several
  * Try a few algorithms you are free to use sklearn or whatever library you prefer
